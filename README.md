# AI-Powered Customer Support Automation System using LangGraph

## Project Overview

This project implements an AI-powered customer support automation system for **ABC Technologies**, a SaaS company that provides cloud-based business management software.

The system automates customer support by identifying customer intent, routing queries to the appropriate department, retrieving relevant information from company documents using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), maintaining conversation history using SQLite memory, handling human approval for high-risk requests, and generating professional responses through a supervisor agent.

The project is built using **LangGraph**, **LangChain**, **Groq LLM**, **ChromaDB**, and **SQLite**.
